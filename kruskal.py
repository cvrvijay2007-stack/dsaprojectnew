"""Kruskal's algorithm, recorded as a sequence of visualisation steps.

1. ``start``    - sort every edge by weight; each node is its own tree.
2. ``consider`` - take the cheapest edge not yet checked (``pick``); ``candidates``
                  is the remaining queue in sorted order, including the pick.
3. ``add``      - its ends are in different trees, so keep it and merge them; or
   ``skip``     - its ends are already connected, so it would form a cycle.

Steps 2-3 repeat until the tree has n-1 edges (``add`` carries ``done``) or the
queue runs out first - the graph is disconnected, and a final ``done`` step
reports the weight of the spanning forest.

Ties on weight are broken by the lowest edge index, matching Prim's trace.
