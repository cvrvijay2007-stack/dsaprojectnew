"""Prim's algorithm, recorded as a sequence of visualisation steps.

The trace mirrors how the UI teaches the algorithm:

1. ``start``    - the start node joins the tree.
2. ``frontier`` - every edge crossing the cut (one end in the tree, one out) is a
                  candidate; the cheapest one is highlighted as the pick.
3. ``add``      - the picked edge and its outside node join the tree.

Steps 2-3 repeat until every node is in the tree (``add`` carries ``done``), or
the frontier is empty while nodes remain - the graph is disconnected, and a
final ``done`` step reports the spanning-forest weight of the reached component.

Ties on weight are broken by the lowest edge index, so traces are deterministic.
